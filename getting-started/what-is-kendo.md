# What is Kendo UI

Kendo UI is an HTML5, jQuery-based framework for building modern web apps. The framework features more than a dozen UI components, a rich data vizualization framework, an auto-adaptive Mobile framework, and all of the tools needed for HTML5 app development, such as Data Binding, Templating, Drag-and-Drop API, and more.

When you start building with Kendo UI, you have all the core pieces you need to build rich web applications, including:

* UI widgets
* Client-side DataSource
* High-performance Templates
* Data Binding
* Drag-and-Drop API
* Animations
* Built-in touch support

Thereâ€™s no need to manually assemble a full framework for HTML app development; Kendo UI provides all the building blocks, designed to seamlessly work together. It's not just UI, but so much more.

## Built for Performance

Every aspect of Kendo UI has been built to deliver performance before providing a laundry list of features. No shortcuts have been made to artificially inflate the Kendo UI feature set. 

## Built for Real World Use

Even though Kendo UI is built to leverage the power of new HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies, it is also built for the realities of a world that does not universally support HTML5 today. In fact, Kendo helps developers adopt the latest in web standards faster by automatically handling the support for older browsers. It does for HTML5 application development what jQuery does for JavaScript.
